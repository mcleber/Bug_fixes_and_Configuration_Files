## 🛠️ Gowin EDA 1.9.12.01 Installation on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS

This tutorial shows how to install Gowin EDA 1.9.12.01 on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS and fix the following errors:

- `symbol lookup error...`
- `QXcbIntegration: Cannot create platform OpenGL context...`

---

### 🔧 Problem

The `symbol lookup error...` occurs because the software tries to use an incompatible version of the `libfreetype` library.

This `QXcbIntegration: Cannot create platform OpenGL context...` error occurs because Gowin EDA depends on legacy OpenGL (GLX/EGL) and older system libraries (such as `libcrypto.so.10`) that are not available by default on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

---

### ✅ Solution

The solution involves renaming a library, creating a symbolic link to another library, and adjusting library paths.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Download the software from the Gowin website and extract it. You will need to provide the network interface MAC address to request the license file, which will be sent by email.

2. Inside the extracted directory, there are two subdirectories: `IDE` and `Programmer`. The `gw_ide` executable is located in `IDE/bin`.
